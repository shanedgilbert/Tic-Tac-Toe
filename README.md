# Tic-Tac-Toe
Created to showcase object oriented programming with Ruby. Done as part of The Odin Project. Runs in the terminal.

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/@shanedgilbert/Tic-Tac-Toe#.replit)

## How It Works:
- A fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
- Prompts the players for names (Player 1, Player 2)
- Prompts the players for where they would like to make their move
  - Checks for repeat position selections
- Checks for 3 in a row or a tie 
- Promps the player if they would like to play again upon game completion

## Reflections
There was a lot for me to learn since this is my first project done completely in Ruby 

### Successes
I was able to understand the logic of the game complete with minimal hurdles *(refer to challenges)*. Took a while to figure out a few of the nuances but quickly debugged and solved the problems.

### Challenges
One of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to determine a 3-in-a-row. Ultimately decided upon using a switch/when to handle each position (1-9). This is a fairly bloated and repetitive system but it solved the issue of finding a winning condition. <br>
I also found trouble in structuring the classes and methods. I did not know at first how many classes/methods I would need and where the methods would rely with respect to the classes. I took an hour to write up a general plan which can be found [here](https://github.com/shanedgilbert/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/pseudo_code.md).
